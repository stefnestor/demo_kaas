# About

`KaaS` (Knowledge as a Service) is an [Obsidian](../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Documentation/Text%20Editors/Obsidian.md) Vault composed of a multitude of notes on a variety of topics that interest me.

Inside is my personal, customized, digital knowledge note-base structured loosely as a [Zettelkasten](../../0-Slipbox/Zettelkasten.md), a collection of interlinked [Atomic Notes](../../0-Slipbox/Atomic%20Notes.md) about anything that interests me.

Consider this my *Digital Garden*. It is a garden that needs to be maintained and cared for overtime to produce fruitful outcomes.

## Features

* Notes are stored locally and are written in *Markdown*
* Notes are versioned and tracked in *3-Resources/Tools/Developer Tools/Version Control/_README* with *Git* and [GitHub](../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Version%20Control/GitHub.md)
* Notes are published in two separate manners: 
  * Open Source Method: Uses *GitHub Actions* and [MkDocs](../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Documentation/Static%20Site%20Generators/MkDocs.md) 
  * *Obsidian Publish*
* Hosted on my personal domain *jimbrig.com*
