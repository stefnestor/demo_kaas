# Vault Setup

## Note Types

* *Daily Notes*: Daily notes for journaling and reflection
* *Meta*: Houses meta-information about the vault itself and its setup (i.e. this note is a meta note!)
* *Maps of Content (MOCs)*: Index notes that form the backbone structure of the vault around common topics.
* *Projects*: Project based notes split between Personal and Professional.
* *Reference*: General Reference notes (i.e. Citations, Sources, and Work Reference Materials)
* *Resources*: Resourceful notes such as embedded websites, highlights from Readwise, etc.
* *Slipbox*: The main folder of the vault. Houses all of my notes in a Zettelkasten manner. 
  * *Fleeting Notes*: Notes that are pre-mature and ephemeral
  * *Literary Notes*: Notes representing external ideas and knowledge that I have captured.
  * *Permanent Notes*: Notes that are considered *Evergreen*, i.e., notes that I have curated and formulated
  * *Concept Notes*: Notes that are just describing or defining a concept or idea.
  * *Structural Notes*: Structure notes are notes that organize other notes
  * *Source Notes*: similar to Literary Notes, but denote a structure specific to a certain source type (i.e. podcast, book, video, course, etc.)
* *Templates*: Templates for various types of notes and situations
