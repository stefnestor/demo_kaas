## Overview

As datasets become larger and larger, it is impossible for people to save them in traditional file formats such as spreadsheet, raw text file, etc., which could not fit on devices with limited storage and could not be easily shared across collaborators. Instead, people nowadays tend to store data in databases for more scalable and reliable data management.

Database systems are often classified based on the [database models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_model) that they support. 

## Relational Databases

* [Relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) became dominant in the 1980s. The data in relational databases is modeled as rows and columns in a series of tables with the use of [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) to express the logic for writing and querying data. 
  * The tables are relational, e.g. you have a user who users your software and those software have creators and contributors. 

This section includes packages that provides access to relational databases within R.

## Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases became popular in recent years due to huge demand in storing unstructured data with the use of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) as the query language.
