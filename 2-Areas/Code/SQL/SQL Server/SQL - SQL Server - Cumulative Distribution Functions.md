## Description

*Cumulative Distribution* functions (CDFs) are a method for analyzing the *statistical distribution* of a quantity, similar to *histograms*. 

They show, for each value of a quantity, what fraction of rows are smaller or greater.

One method for calculating a CDF is as follows:

````SQL
/*
Use a row_number window function to get the position of this row 
and CAST to convert row_number and count from integers to decimal
*/

SELECT CAST(row_number() OVER (ORDER BY <quantity> ASC) AS DECIMAL) / CAST((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <table> ) AS DECIMAL ) AS cdf
FROM <table>
  
````

where:

* `quantity` - the column containing the metric of interest
* `table` - the table name

**Note:** `CAST` is used to convert the numerator and denominator of the fraction into decimals before they are divided. 

## Example

Using some student test scores as an example data source, let’s identify:

* `table` - this is called `Example_data`
* `quantity` - this is the `column score`

then the query becomes:

````SQL
SELECT student_id,
       score,
       CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY score ASC) AS DECIMAL) / CAST(( SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Example_data) AS DECIMAL) AS frac
FROM Example_data
````

Output:

|student_id|score|frac|
|----------|-----|----|
|3|76|0.2|
|5|77|0.2|
|4|82|0.6|
|...|...|...|
|1|97|1|
