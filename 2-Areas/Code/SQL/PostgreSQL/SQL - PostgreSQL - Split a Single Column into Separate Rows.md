## Description

You will often see multiple values, separated by a single character, appear in a single column. 

If you want to split them out but instead of having separate columns, generate rows for each value, you can use the function [`REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-string.html):

````sql
WITH data AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM (VALUES ('yellow;green;blue'), ('orange;red;grey;black')) AS data (str)
)

SELECT
  REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(str,';') str_split
FROM data;
````

*The separator can be any single character (i.e. `','` or `/`) or something more complex like a string (`to&char123`), as the function uses Regular Expressions.* 

Output:

|str_split|
|---------|
|yellow|
|green|
|blue|
|orange|
|red|
|grey|
|black|
