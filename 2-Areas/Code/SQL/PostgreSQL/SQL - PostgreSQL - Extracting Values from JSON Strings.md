## Description

[PostgreSQL](../../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Data%20Stack/Databases/PostgreSQL.md) has supported lots of *JSON* functionality for a while now - see some examples in the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html).

## Operators

There are several operators that act as accessors on *JSON* data types:

````sql
with json as (select '{
  "a": 1,
  "b": "bee",
  "c": [
    4,
    5,
    { "d": [6, 7] }
  ]
}' as text)

select
  text::json as root, -- Cast text to JSON
  text::json->'a' as a, -- Extract number as string
  text::json->'b' as b, -- Extract string
  text::json->'c' as c, -- Extract object
  text::json->'c'->0 as c_first_str, -- Extract array element as string
  text::json->'c'->>0 as c_first_num, -- Extract array element as number
  text::json#>'{c, 2}' as c_third, -- Extract deeply-nested object
  text::json#>'{c, 2}'->'d' as d -- Extract field from deeply-nested object
from json
````

Output:

|root|a|b|c|c_first_str|c_first_num|c_third|d|
|----|-|-|-|-----------|-----------|-------|-|
|{ "a": 1, "b": "bee", "c": \[4, 5, { "d": \[6, 7\] }\]}|1|"bee"|\[4, 5, { "d": \[6, 7\] }\]|4|4|{ "d": \[6, 7\] }|\[6, 7\]|

## JSON_EXTRACT_PATH

As an alternative to the operator approach, the `JSON_EXTRACT_PATH` function works by specifying the keys of the `JSON` fields to be extracted:

````sql
select
  json_extract_path('{
  "a": 1,
  "b": "bee",
  "c": [
    4,
    5,
    { "d": [6, 7] }
  ]
}', 'c', '2', 'd', '0')
````

Output:

|json_extract_path|
|-----------------|
|6|
