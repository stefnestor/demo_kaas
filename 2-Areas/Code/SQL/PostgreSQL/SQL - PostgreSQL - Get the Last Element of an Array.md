## Description

Use the `array_length` function to access the final element of an array. This function takes two arguments, an array and a dimension index. For common one-dimensional arrays, the dimension index is always `1`.

````sql
with data as (select array[1,2,3,4] as nums)

select nums[array_length(nums, 1)] from data
````
