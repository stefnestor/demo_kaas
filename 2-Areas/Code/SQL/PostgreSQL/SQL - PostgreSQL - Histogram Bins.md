## Description

Creating histograms using [SQL](../../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Data%20Stack/Procedural%20Languages/SQL.md) can be tricky. This template will let you quickly create the bins needed to create a histogram:

````sql
SELECT 
   COUNT(1) / (SELECT COUNT(1) FROM <schema.table> ) AS percentage_of_results
   FLOOR(<column>/ <bin-size>) * <bin-size> AS bin
FROM
   <schema.table>
GROUP BY 
   bin
````

where:

* `<column>` is your column you want to turn into a histogram
* `<bin-size>` is the width of each bin. You can adjust this to get the desired level of detail for the histogram.

## Example

Adjust the bin-size until you can see the 'shape' of the data. The following example finds the percentage of fruits with 5-point review groupings. The reviews are on a 0-100 scale: 

````sql
WITH data AS (
    SELECT CASE
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.25 THEN 'tennessee'
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.5 THEN 'colonel'
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.75 THEN 'pikesville'
      ELSE 'michters'
    END AS whiskey,
    CASE
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.20 THEN 1
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.40 THEN 2
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.60 THEN 3
        WHEN RANDOM() <= 0.80 THEN 4
      ELSE 5
    END AS star_rating,
    review_date
    FROM generate_series('2021-01-01'::TIMESTAMP,'2021-01-31'::TIMESTAMP,  '3 DAY') AS review_date
)

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(1)::FLOAT FROM data) AS percentage_of_results,
  FLOOR(data.star_rating / 1) * 1 bin
FROM data
GROUP BY bin
````

Output:

|percentage_of_results|bin|
|---------------------|---|
|0.2727272727272727|3|
|0.09090909090909091|5|
|0.18181818181818182|1|
|0.45454545454545453|2|
