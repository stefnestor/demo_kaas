## Description

Cumulative Distribution is a method for analyzing the distribution of a quantity, similar to histograms. 

They show, for each value of a quantity, what fraction of rows are smaller or greater.

One method for calculating it is as follows:

````sql
SELECT
  -- If necessary, use a row_number window function to get the position of this row in the dataset
  (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY <quantity>)) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM <schema.table>) AS cume_dist,
  <quantity>,
FROM <schema.table>
````

where

* `quantity` - the column containing the metric of interest
* `schema.table` - the table with your data

## Example

````sql
WITH data AS (
    SELECT md5(RANDOM()::TEXT) AS username_hash,
           RANDOM() AS random_number,
           row_number
    FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1, 10) AS row_number
)

SELECT
  --we do not need to use a row_number window function as we have a generate_series in our test data set
   username_hash,
  (row_number::FLOAT / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data)) AS frac,
  random_number
FROM data;
````

Output:

|username_hash|frac|random_number|
|-------------|----|-------------|
