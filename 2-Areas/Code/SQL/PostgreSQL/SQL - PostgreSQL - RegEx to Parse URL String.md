# SQL - PostgreSQL - RegEx to Parse URL String

*Source: [sql-snippets/regex-parse-url.md at main · count/sql-snippets (github.com)](https://github.com/count/sql-snippets/blob/main/postgres/regex-parse-url.md)*

## Description

`URL` strings are a very valuable source of information, but trying to get your RegEx exactly right is a pain.

This re-usable snippet can be applied to any URL to extract the exact part you're after. 

## Snippet ✂️

````sql
SELECT
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '^([a-zA-Z]+)://') AS protocol,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '(?:[a-zA-Z]+:\/\/)?([a-zA-Z0-9.]+)\/?') AS host,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '(?:[a-zA-Z]+://)?(?:[a-zA-Z0-9.]+)/{1}([a-zA-Z0-9./]+)') AS path,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '\?(.*)') AS query,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '#(.*)') AS ref
FROM <schema.tablename>
````

where:

* `<my_url>` is your URL string (e.g. `"https://www.yoursite.com/pricing/details?myparam1=123&myparam2=abc#Ref1"`
* `protocol` is how the data is transferred between the host and server (e.g. `https`)
* `host` is the domain name (e.g. `yoursite.com`)
* `path` is the page path on the website (e.g. `pricing/details`)
* `query` is the string of query parameters in the url (e.g. `myparam1=123`)
* `ref` is the reference or where the user came from before visiting the url (e.g. `#newsfeed`)

## Usage

To use the snippet, just copy out the *RegEx* for whatever part of the URL you need - or capture them all as in the example below: 

````sql
WITH data as 
    (SELECT 'https://www.yoursite.com/pricing/details?myparam1=123&myparam2=abc#newsfeed' AS my_url)

SELECT
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '^([a-zA-Z]+)://') AS protocol,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '(?:[a-zA-Z]+:\/\/)?([a-zA-Z0-9.]+)\/?') AS host,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '(?:[a-zA-Z]+://)?(?:[a-zA-Z0-9.]+)/{1}([a-zA-Z0-9./]+)') AS path,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '\?(.*)') AS query,
  SUBSTRING(my_url, '#(.*)') AS ref
FROM data
````

Output:

|protocol|host|path|query|ref|
|--------|----|----|-----|---|
|https|www.yoursite.com|pricing/details|myparam1=123&myparam2=abc#newsfeed|newsfeed|
