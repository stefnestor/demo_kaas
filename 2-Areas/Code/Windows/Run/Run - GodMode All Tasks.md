## About

**All Tasks** (also known as *God Mode*) is an advanced power-user menu accessed using [Windows Shell Commands](../../../../0-Slipbox/Windows%20Shell%20Commands.md). 

The GUID for All Tasks is `{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}` and the shell command is `shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}`.

The easiest way to launch God Mode is via the *Run Dialogue* via `Win + R`:

````powershell
shell:::{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
````
