## Explorer

*Source: Originally from [How to Restart File Explorer in Windows 11 (winaero.com)](https://winaero.com/how-to-restart-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?utm_source=software&utm_medium=in-app&utm_campaign=winaerotweaker&utm_content=contextmenurestartexplorer#Restart_Explorerexe_in_Windows_11_using_a_script), but I enhanced some.*

### Enhanced Solution

* Add `/fi` flag for calling `ShellCommon.dll` to ensure I am only killing to main shell, and not any other Explorer Windows.

````powershell
cmd.exe /c taskkill /f /im explorer.exe /fi "modules eq Windows.Internal.ShellCommon.dll" & start explorer.exe
````

If you want to restart with a pause then:

````powershell
cmd.exe /c @echo off & 
    echo The explorer.exe process will be terminated & echo. &
    taskkill /f /im explorer.exe /fi "modules eq Windows.Internal.ShellCommon.dll" & echo. & 
    echo Done & echo. & 
    echo Press any key to start explorer.exe process & pause>NUL & start explorer.exe & 
    exit
````

### Original Solution

* Using a *Batch* File: `restart-explorer.bat`:

````powershell
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
start explorer.exe
exit
````

* Using Command Line:

````powershell
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
start explorer.exe
````

## Start Menu

As you may already know, the Start menu in previous Windows 10 releases has been hosted by a system process called `ShellExperienceHost.exe`.

In Windows 10 May 2019 Update Microsoft has separated it into its own process, called **`StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`**.

This gives the Start menu a performance boost and resolves a number of issues like delays in launching some Win32 apps. Users will noticeÂ measurable improvements in Start reliability. The Start menu is now opening significantly faster.

Full Path: `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\StartMenuExperienceHost.exe`

Restart Command:

````powershell
taskkill /im StartMenuExperienceHost.exe /f\
start C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\StartMenuExperienceHost.exe
````
