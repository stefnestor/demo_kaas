# WSL Terminal and Shell Setup Guide

* Terminal Emulator: *Microsoft Windows Terminal* (Preview)
* Shell: [zsh](../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Shell/zsh.md) (or z-shell) + [oh-my-zsh](../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Shell/oh-my-zsh.md)
* Theme: [powerlevel10k](../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Shell/powerlevel10k.md) + a [Nerdfont](../../../3-Resources/Tools/Developer%20Tools/Shell/Nerdfont.md)

## Install Zsh

````bash
sudo apt-get install zsh
zsh
````

when prompted, select `0` to create config file and prevent message from showing again (I will customize configuration when installing oh-my-zsh).

## Install oh-my-zsh

Before running the installation script, may be helpful to setup *Git* first:

````bash
sudo apt-get -y install git
git config --global user.name "Jimmy Briggs"
git config --global user.name "jimmy.briggs@jimbrig.com"
````

Then install oh-my-zsh:

````bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
````

This will clone the repo and replace the existing `~/.zshrc` with a template from `oh-my-zsh`. When prompted, set zsh as default shell.

## Install Powerline

First, need Nerdfonts; From a Windows Terminal (i.e. *3-Resources/Tools/PowerShell*):

````PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
cd fonts
.\install.ps1
````

This will install all the fonts on your Windows. You might get an error from PowerShell blocking you from running the script. Check [this out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system) if it happens with you. Make sure to reverse the policy after.

### Change Directory Colors

The directory colors for zsh is awful. If you followed along, by now you should have an ugly yellow or dark blue background on folders when `ls/ll`. Luckily, we can change that by installing a Solarized Color Theme from [here](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized).

````bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized/master/dircolors.ansi-dark --output ~/.dircolors
````

Edit your `~/.zshrc`:

````bash
## set colors for LS_COLORS
eval `dircolors ~/.dircolors`
````

### Configure Zsh and oh-my-zsh

* Edit `~/.zshrc`
  * Set `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"`
  *
