## Actions

1. Create a list of 50 blog post ideas - [Blog Post Ideas List](Blog%20Post%20Ideas%20List.md).
1. Never let the list drop below 30 ideas. When it does, brainstorm new ideas to keep it at or above 50.
1. Pick the best 3 ideas and those will be my first three blog posts.

This will take ~30 minutes to complete. Use the full 30 minutes.

Track these ideas somewhere else if needed then migrate in during reviews.

## Brainstorming Checklist

* Tutorials and how-to's
* Book and product reviews 
* News roundups
* Commentaries on other blog posts and news articles

* Interviews with people in my field 
* Lists of things (Top 10 ways to ..., My 7 Favorite ...)
* Controversial / provocative posts
* Video or Vlog posts
* Guest posts (let someone else do the writing)

## Additional Help

### Useful Tactics

* Try looking around sites like [HackerNews](), [Reddit](), [Dev.to](), [Medium](), etc. to find posts that are popular and see if I can write a similar kind of post, but tailored to my particular theme.

* Start a conversation with someone at work about a topic or go out to lunch and talk shop. 
  
  * What topics came up?
  * What am I especially passionate about?
  * Direct my energy into a blog post topic from here.
* Ask someone else to come up with a few blog post titles for me.

* Come up with blog post titles that start with each letter of the alphabet. Sometimes having a constraint like this is helpful as it forces you to get creative and engage.

* Look through a book related to my theme or technology and come up with posts about each of the chapters in the book.

* Pick categories or sub-themes for posts and group post ideas into a category. Think about what categories of topics I'd like to blog about and try to come up with ~5 categories and 10 post ideas for each category.

* Don't focus on a perfect title, ideas are what's important in this initial step.
