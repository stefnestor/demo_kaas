# FAST - Factory for Actuarial Solution Technology

See Also: [FAST - Data Platforming Management Key Activities](FAST%20-%20Data%20Platforming%20Management%20Key%20Activities.md)

*We need to create an infrastructure model to support our development of IP, solutions and products*

## Why?

**Our future growth trajectory is dependent on how we showcase our capabilities to help solve clientsâ€™ complex problems, and the way we will do that most effectively is through building and marketing our use cases. While we have made a good start the last few years, we are not maximizing our investments, leveraging our IP, nor making fast enough progress**

## Purpose

Develop a more consistent framework to build IP/Solutions that we can scale, bring coordination and transparency around what we are investing in and what competencies are needed to succeed, make sure we are leveraging our (and the Firms) investments/assets, and appropriately connecting with our Alliances/Vendors.

## Responsibilities

* Manage and prioritize our development pipeline
* *Liaise* with Platform leads on solution/client needs
* *Liaise* with AS specialty/ESG leads on trust solutions needs
* Manage the coordination of our alliances and vendors and connectivity into PwC Alliance teams (i.e. AWS credits)
* Coordinate and collaborative platform for technology teams
* Coordination with AC teams
* Coordinate the sourcing and management of data needed to develop our solutions (i.e. CDO, XDP, synthetic data, external data MIB)
* Identify tools and technologies we invest in and deploy
* Establish and maintain the infrastructure needed to develop and deploy our solutions
* Source internal/external capabilities needed to develop our assets

*List out initiative information, purpose and goals, team members, and projects here*
