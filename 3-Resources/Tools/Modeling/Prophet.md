## Data Management Platform

The components of the Prophet Data Management Platform are:

Flexible Results and the Flexible Results API. Flexible Results is an addition to Prophet Enterprise that allows writing of results to a distributed database system thereby achieving improved runtimes and greater scale in output. The Flexible Results API provides the ability to retrieve data directly and pass this to other database applications such as the Insurance Data Repository.

The **Insurance Data Repository**, which helps customers map Prophet output data to dimensions that are directly meaningful to the business, and for regulatory submissions. This offering underpins insurersâ€™ ability to disseminate risk information effectively while reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies that can arise through over-reliance on end-user computing tools, such as spreadsheets.

The [**Prophet Control Centre**](https://www.prophet-web.com/prophet-products/prophet-control-centre/), which is a highly configurable end-to-end process automation tool, allowing customers to define their business processes diagrammatically, including user interactions with the end users, and converting those definitions into running instances of the processes.
