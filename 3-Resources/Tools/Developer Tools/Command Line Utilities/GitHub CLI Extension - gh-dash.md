## Configuring

Configuration is provided within a `config.yml` file under the extension's directory (usually `~/.config/gh-dash/`)

The default `config.yml` file contains:

````yml
prSections:
  - title: My Pull Requests
    filters: is:open author:@me
  - title: Needs My Review
    filters: is:open review-requested:@me
  - title: Subscribed
    filters: is:open -author:@me repo:cli/cli repo:dlvhdr/gh-dash
    limit: 50 # optional limit per section
issuesSections:
  - title: Created
    filters: is:open author:@me
  - title: Assigned
    filters: is:open assignee:@me
  - title: Subscribed
    filters: is:open -author:@me repo:microsoft/vscode repo:dlvhdr/gh-dash
defaults:
  prsLimit: 20 # global limit
  issuesLimit: 20 # global limit
  preview:
    open: true
    width: 60
````

Adding a PR or issue section is as easy as adding to the list of `prSections` or `issueSections` respectively:

* title - shown in the TUI
* filters - how the repo's PRs should be filtered - these are plain [github filters](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests)
