# R Package - imaginator

*Source: [casact/imaginator: Randomly simulate inception and settlement of general insurance losses](https://github.com/casact/imaginator)*

This is a package which will simulate a set of individual claims with random occurrence, report and payment lags. This algorithm was first proposed by James Stanard, whose original paper may be found here: [A SIMULATION TEST OF PREDICTION ERRORS OF LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES](https://www.casact.org/pubs/proceed/proceed85/85124.pdf).

Future developments may include multiple payments per claim, simulated case reserves.
