## Overview

RMariaDB is a database interface and MariaDB driver for R. This version is aimed at full compliance with the [DBI specification](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DBI/vignettes/spec.html), as a replacement for the old [RMySQL](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RMySQL) package.

## Example

````R
library(DBI)
# Connect to my-db as defined in ~/.my.cnf
con <- dbConnect(RMariaDB::MariaDB(), group = "my-db")

dbListTables(con)
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars)
dbListTables(con)

dbListFields(con, "mtcars")
dbReadTable(con, "mtcars")

# You can fetch all results:
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4")
dbFetch(res)
dbClearResult(res)

# Or a chunk at a time
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4")
while(!dbHasCompleted(res)){
  chunk <- dbFetch(res, n = 5)
  print(nrow(chunk))
}
# Clear the result
dbClearResult(res)

# Disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)
````

## Installation

````R
install.packages("RMariaDB")

devtools::install_github("r-dbi/DBI")
devtools::install_github("r-dbi/RMariaDB")
````

Discussions associated with DBI and related database packages take place on [R-SIG-DB](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-db). The website [Databases using R](https://db.rstudio.com/) describes the tools and best practices in this ecosystem.

Installation from source on Linux or OS X currently requires [`MariaDB Connector/C`](https://downloads.mariadb.org/connector-c/), preferably in version 2.3.4/3.0.3 or later. With older versions, character and blob columns do not work reliably. Alternatively, Oracle’s [libmysqlclient](https://packages.debian.org/buster/default-libmysqlclient-dev) can be used.

### Connector/C

On recent **Debian** or **Ubuntu** install [libmariadb-dev](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libmariadb-dev).

````bash
sudo apt-get install -y libmariadb-dev
````

On **Fedora**, **CentOS** or **RHEL** we need [mariadb-devel](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mariadb):

````bash
sudo yum install mariadb-devel
````

On **OS X** use [mariadb-connector-c](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mariadb-connector-c.rb) from Homebrew:

````bash
brew install mariadb-connector-c
````

### MySQL client library

On recent **Debian** or **Ubuntu** install [libmysqlclient-dev](https://packages.debian.org/buster/default-libmysqlclient-dev).

````bash
sudo apt-get install -y libmysqlclient-dev
````

On **Fedora**, **CentOS** or **RHEL** we need mysql-devel, see [https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/mysql-devel](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/mysql-devel):

````bash
sudo yum install mysql-devel
````

Follow [instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-yum-repo-quick-guide/en/) to enable the MySQL yum repository if the above command attempts to install MariaDB files.

On **OS X** use [mysql-connector-c](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/mysql-connector-c++.rb) from Homebrew:

````bash
brew install mysql-connector-c++
````

## MariaDB configuration file

Instead of specifying a username and password in calls to `[dbConnect()](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html)`, it’s better to set up a MariaDB configuration file that names the databases that you connect to most commonly. This file should live in `~/.my.cnf` and look like:

````ini
[database_name]
option1=value1
option2=value2
````

If you want to run the examples, you’ll need to set the proper options in the `[rs-dbi]` group of any MariaDB option file, such as /etc/my.cnf or the .my.cnf file in your home directory. For a default single user install of MariaDB, the following code should work:

````ini
[rs-dbi]
database="test"
user="root"
password=""
````
