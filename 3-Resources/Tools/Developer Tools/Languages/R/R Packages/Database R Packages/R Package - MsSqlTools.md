## Overview

An R package that contains convenience functions for establishing ODBC connections to Microsoft SQL Server using either Microsoft's ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server or the FreeTDS driver.

## Usage

* See [connectMsSql.R](https://github.com/nathan-palmer/MsSqlTools/blob/master/R/connectMsSql.R):
