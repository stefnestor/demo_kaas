## About

Keeping your system up to date usually involves invoking multiple package managers. This results in big, non-portable shell one-liners saved in your shell. To remedy this, *topgrade* detects which tools you use and runs the appropriate commands to update them.

* Arch Linux: [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/topgrade/) package.
* NixOS: *topgrade* package in `nixpkgs`.
* macOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php).

Other systems users can either use `cargo install` or use the compiled binaries from the release page. The compiled binaries contain a self-upgrading feature.

Topgrade requires Rust 1.51 or above.

## Usage

Just run `topgrade`. See [the wiki](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade/wiki/Step-list) for the list of things Topgrade supports.

## Example

When I run `topgrade` from an Administrative Shell, it performs the following steps in sequence (see the Customization, Configuration, and Custom Commands sections below for details):

## Customization

See [`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade/blob/develop/config.example.toml) for an example configuration file.

My Configuration File is slightly more advanced and looks like this:

* `%APPDATA%\topgrade.toml` (Windows)

### Configuration path

The configuration should be placed in the following paths depending by the operating system:

* **Windows** - `%APPDATA%/topgrade.toml`
* **macOS** and **other Unix systems** - `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/topgrade.toml`

## Custom Commands

Notice that I implement the following custom commands in my configuration file under this section:

````toml
# Custom commands
[commands]
"Gcloud Components" = "sudo cmd.exe /c 'gcloud components update'" 
"R Packages" = "& Rscript -e \"update.packages(lib.loc = .libPaths()[[1]], repos = 'https://cloud.r-project.org/', ask = FALSE)\""
"Choco Package List Backup" = "cmd.exe /c 'cplb'"
"Choco Cleanup" = "sudo cmd.exe /c 'choco-cleaner'"
"System Cleanup" = "sudo cmd.exe /c Cleanmgr /sageset:65535 & Cleanmgr /sagerun:65535"
"SFC Scan" = "sudo cmd.exe /c 'sfc /scannow'"
````

These commands tell Topgrade to perform the following additional steps:

* Update `gcloud` components
* Update my R Packages
* Run `choco-pakcage-list-backup` (cplb)
* Run `choco-cleaner`
* Perform a *deep* background system cleanup via `cleanmgr`
* Run an SFC Scan via `sfc /scannow`

## Step List

Here's a comprehensive listing of Topgrade's complete list of tasks it can perform:

* **Linux**: Run the system package manager:
  * **Arch based**: Run [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) or fall back to pacman
  * **Redhat based**: Run `yum upgrade` (or `dnf` if present)
  * **Debian based**: Run `apt update && apt dist-upgrade`
  * **Clear Linux**: Run `swupd update`
  * **Gentoo**: Run `layman -s ALL && emerge --sync -q && eix-update && emerge -uDNa world`
  * **openSUSE**: Run `zypper refresh && zypper dist-upgrade`
  * **Void**: Run `xbps-install -Su`
* **Linux**: Run [etc-update](https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/man/etc-update.1.html):
* **DragonFly BSD**: Upgrade and audit packages
* **FreeBSD**: Upgrade and audit packages

* **Windows**: Upgrade all [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) packages
* Check if the following paths are tracked by Git. If so, pull them:
  * ~/.emacs.d (Should work whether you use [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) or a custom configuration)

* Upgrade Atom packages
* Run `gem upgrade --user-install` if `~/.gem` exists
* **Linux**: Update Flatpak packages
* **Linux**: Update snap packages
* **Linux**: Run [fwupdmgr](https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd) to show firmware upgrade. (View only. No upgrades will actually be performed)
* **Linux**: Run [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) updater
* Run custom defined commands
* Final stage
  * **Linux**: Run [needrestart](https://github.com/liske/needrestart)
  * **Windows**: Run Windows Update (You'll have to install [PSWindowsUpdate](https://marckean.com/2016/06/01/use-powershell-to-install-windows-updates/))
  * **macOS**: Upgrade App Store applications using [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
  * **macOS**: Upgrade the system
  * **FreeBSD**: Run `freebsd-upgrade`

## Remote execution

You can specify a key called `remote_topgrades` in the configuration file. This key should contain a list of hostnames that have topgrade installed on them. Topgrade will use `ssh` to run `topgrade` on remote hosts before acting locally. To limit the execution only to specific hosts use the `--remote-host-limit` parameter.
