## Overview

[Universal Silent Switch Finder](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Launchers-Shutdown-Tools/Universal-Silent-Switch-Finder.shtml) (USSF) is about as accurate a program name as I’ve ever seen.   If you haven’t guessed  already, Universal Silent Switch Finder attempts to detect the silent switch or parameter for an executable. Simply launch the program and point it to an executable file, and it’ll take care of the rest.

Full disclaimer, I’ve had mixed results using USSF. Some apps simply don’t have a silent switch option, in which case USSF was never going to find anything. Another possible explanation for my mixed results could be that USSF hasn’t been updated in quite some time. Regardless, when you need to find a silent parameter, and you’ve already tried the other resources, USSF is worth a shot.
