* What's the Key Outcome to Have This Week?
  Summary:
  Coming off a week like i had last week, it was really important for me to kind of look at the calendar ahead and say to myself, you know, this is really serving me. Some of those meetings will have been booked months ago. Sometime they're just recurring meetings. A question you can ask yourself is, what is the key outcome i'm trying to get from that meeting? And why is that so important to have this week? Sometimes you can eliminate a meeting, but you still need that outcome.

And why is that so important to have this week? Because sometimes you can eliminate a meeting, but you still need that outcome. And what i mean is, if you can identify that question.

Belik a, do i need to be there you now? I'm kind of overloaded to have these other prioritie, so yea, consider, consider those commidments. Make sure you're clear on why you're doing it.
