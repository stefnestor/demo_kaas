* How Do You Think Kubernetes Has Changed the Development of Saftware?
  Summary:
  There's a lot of ready clear delineation with cubenets that makes life easier. The biggest change is to beve gone from this, you know, building the bindary on your desk top machine,. You can largely out, language agnostic, andto a binery that could then run on any blinnox eunuch's host. I'm retty fascinated by technologyst like auto pilot from gugal.

  thinktht. There's a lot of ready clear delineation with cubenets that makes life easier. I have been in the sofer industry for a long time. Thank you for reminding me. Makes me feel like an old man. And i have had a conversation about punc cards early in my career. That did happen when you originally deployed soft ware? Often it was a case of justo copying a bindery on to another server every soffer engineer in the team having access to production service in this kind of a risky process. Nobody really wants to do that. You know, we want to be able to have gates and approval processes in place for our own security unionan we want to know what happenedwhe and we want to know why it happens. And that' pay. The biggest change is to beve gone from this, you know, building the bindary on your desk top machine, and using s c p, you copy that to another machine, and then, you know, deleting the existing one with r m and copying the new oned performing a service re start. You know, that is such a manual process and such a risky processs and such an oo aeroprone process. When we originally got docker and the ability to package any kind of sopher application, you can largely out, language agnostic, andto a binery that could then run on any blinnox eunuch's host, that was fantastic. Far suddenly you're in a position. It made it very easy to do. But you're early in that cubenets germany people were, you know, i've been using cubenett since version one, three, i think. So we're on two, one, 20. So, you know, 15 % through the cubenetis journey. You know, people didn't understand some of the things were happening in this awful application. And i can again recall telling you a war story here, geoffrey, i can recall having to goggle the term crashed loop back off, and i found no results for the term crashed loop back off. And i didn't know what it meant. Ad i couldn't figure out what meant. And we had te we gun figured that it meant that the application was crashing and it was in a loop. And it was backing off, trying restart it because it was in a loop. And now, you know, every developer knows exactly what a crash loop back off is. And ofiss, you're terrified a bit. And the cubenetis makes that really easy for people to do. Provides that ire back that are mentioned earlier, provides kind of a declarative way to say, you know, what do i want my application to look like? And then provides kind of realy, well, this is something aproaced o mentioned earlier, lie really good documentation that's realy easy to understand and really use to read. That is incredibly valuable. You know, you know, i don't want lots of documentation. I want the minimum amount of the right kind of documentation to understand it. And coubenettis just puts all that documentation out into the public domain, so any any developer can use. And any developer coming into a company that's us ing cubenettis, you know, can just get started really quickly. They can avoid doing hat. I think that's now one of the great things where we are to day. I'm retty fascinated by technologyst like auto pilot from gugal.
  Speaker 2
  You know, auto pilot no, is that?
  Speaker 1
  So it's a new version. It's this pretty new version, maybe you sit a month or two old, of gugl cloud's cubeneti service that basically reduces the amount of operational work that you have to do. That's just what's great about it. So that's the it. I don't have to worry about operations. It scales everything up and down for me automatically. I don't have to install all the metrics and so forth. And i think we're going to move more in that direction of a more managed solution on cubinetis were where users don't have to think too much about things like right sizing their applications, getting resources right, structuring th right. I think ust all just going to become meat and potatoes, tophu and potatoes for developersa they can go focus on those things. Eue, you get it eltimate my gols. Get it done quickly. Get it done reliably.
  Speaker 2
  And i
  Speaker 1
  don't want to spend too much time an effort on that. And i think that's how we're ging to see it evolve overtime. And i think it'll become like a stable platform as well. I could see fewer cubinenies releases overtime. Because when an application is mature and stable ad it doesn't need too many new features. You don't actually often need musof releases of it.
