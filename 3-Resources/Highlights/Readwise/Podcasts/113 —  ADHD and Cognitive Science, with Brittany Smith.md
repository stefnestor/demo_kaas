* How to Form Strong Habits
  Summary:
  One of the common themes on our show is habits. I think it's a great tool to help yourself find focus. There has to be internal motivation for anyone to form a habit. The biggest hurdle to starting a habit with folks i'm working with is usually that they're trying to do too much. And so one of the things i'll work with is like, let's start what's minimum viable and then build on more later.

  go up and down on that, because it is exactly what you say, it's not that big of a deal. But then at the moment, it feels like a huge deal. And
  Speaker 1
  if it's something you're repeating a lot, it's worth doing something about. If it's something youre goin to do a bunch, just hit the extra button, or whatever the thing is, and get it done. But, um, but there are, there are ways we can look at it and criteria we can evaluate aps with. Like, you know, if a task manager's ugly, i'm not going to kep using it, so i won't pick that one. Or, you know, notice the things in your computing life. Oh right, i went down that rabbit hole. What happened before that? And to start noticing, cause it will be different for each person. One

  of the common themes on our show is habits. I think it's a great tool to help yourself find focus. Um, do does a d h d make habit formation easier or harder complicated?
  Speaker 1
  It makes it complicated. Ok? There has to be internal motivation for anyone to form a habit. Um, that is more so with ah d. But that's just cause we're more so kind of people. Am? We can form really, really strong habits. That's a bad thing if you're looking at a risk for things like alcoholism, but it can be a really good thing if i don't have to think about it any more a usually, because i formed the habit with short cuts. But whatever. I know that i do push ups, and then i do plank, and then i do sit up. As long as we can gather, like, the extra will power to start forming the habit, cause it does drain more will more will power while you form the habit, you'll use less later when you just follow the habit, sticking to it can be hard. Fore good at not wanting to do things that are boring. But it can be really, really powerful. But it does take a lot of to set up. Ok,
  Speaker 2
  so if i'm hearing you correctly, it sounds like h when it comes to habits, maybe the creation of them, let's just talk about the creation of a new positive habit. The creation of that habit, getting it to the point where you don't really have to think about it as much, that's going to take longer, perhaps. But then once you get to that point, it'll be easier be to stick with it than it would be otherwisey.
  Speaker 1
  And it depends on how much is physical versus mental. I don't know how to go into more detail than that, but it's differently something i've noticed. Not read any papers on. Um. The biggest hurdle to starting a habit with folks i'm working with is usually that they're trying to do too much. If i'm going tostart a morning routine, i'd better add exercise, better add meditation, i'd better add all the things, until suddenly it's not possible. So why start? And so i'll see that a lot. And so one of the things i'll work with is like, let's start what's minimum viable habit. And you know, if they can really buy in at that level, you can always build on more later. But right now, if doing that big one isn't working, let's try the smaller one. Cause we, our eyes are bigger than our stomach when it comes to tackling things a lot of the time.
