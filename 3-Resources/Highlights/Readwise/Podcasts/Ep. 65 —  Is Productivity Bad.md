  A job that forces you to be in, you know, downtown l a is
  Speaker 1
  not going to be nearly as good as a fit for you is a job that's in,
  Speaker 2
  you know, bolder colorado, or as fully remote, so you can live,
  Speaker 1
  you know, in ashville or something like this,
  Speaker 2
  and still do the work. So,
  Speaker 1
  life style factors, is it congruent? Like, were the the
  Speaker 2
  the culture of the company, the location and the work rhythms? Is it congruent with the things i generally am looking for in a life stile i enjoy. So these things matter. This seems interesting.

  for the general type of life style i want to live.

  I would add a fourth thing.
  Speaker 1
  It seems like it will reward career capital with options and flexibility. So you want to make sure that this is a job that there are skills you can master, and if you do master them, it will give you options. It will be rewarded. And the type of reward i care about here is more etonomy, not just financial autonomy. This is the problem, for example, with corporate

  Speaker 1
  as you get better, you get more options. Ore people want your services. You can, you can, you can trade your cur capital, you know, for different types of projects. It's ou know, if you become an excellent computer programmor, you have more options. Lo
  Speaker 2
  i could
  Speaker 1
  go work for this company. I could start my own company. I could do free lands. I could just work six months a year. So that that'd be the fourth thing i would say. ([Time 0:41:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00f78c7d-d77e-412e-bb07-dcb0602e630f))
