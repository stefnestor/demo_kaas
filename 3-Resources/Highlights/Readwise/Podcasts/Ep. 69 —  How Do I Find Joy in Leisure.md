You're going to bring in, hey, here's non urgent, important things that i want to make progress on. How do you know about these things? Well, when you look at your strategic slash quarterly plans, whatever you call them, when you look at those in preparation for your weekly plan, that's where you have notes on this type of thing. That's where you've clarified what's important to you. That's where you've identified quad two style projects you want to make progress on. You see th when you do your weekly plan. And that's when you remind yourself, o k, friday morning, lest block it off. We're working on this qua to important, but not urgent project.

I'm just going to get rid of it. Im goig to get out of this responsibilit i just not going to do it. I'm going to tell the people i'm sorry. I don't have time. I'm going to ignore it. Whatever. This is also during that configure step where you might say, this is urgent, but it's not really best for me to do. It's not important to me.
