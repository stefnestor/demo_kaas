## Highlights

* Time Blocking - Is it a Good Idea?
  Summary:
  daily, weekly, quarterly. That really seems oget the job done. Batch together small things and elaborate on what they are using labels that you explicate up in the upper right hand corner of your time block page. You could have a thirty minute block or an hour long block. Label it admint or tasks. Put a number in it, like one with a circle in the upper right corner of the page,. put a one with a circle, and list out what are the tasks that you would actually do in that block. A lot of professional writers don't get writer's block either....

  And
  Speaker 2
  it has a few notes about, ok, what am i going to a
  Speaker 1
  shift into as i finish those into the fall? And look those notes when this upcoming week i make my quarterly plan for the fall. And this is going to talk about, it's inside or baseball here, but essentially what papers i'll be working on with what collaborators and towards what time line. So what publication dead lines a 'm working backwards from, and therefore, roughly what type of progress will i need to make. That's a quarterly plan. You're writing these papers. You get to a weekly plan. This as happened monday through wednesday, thand thursday, friday, we're du ere resting, but we have to make sure that we still get this deadline done, et cetera. R, that's a long answer to a short question. But i think i was, i was glad i got a chance theire natalia to actually clarify for people the veriest scales at which it's
  Speaker 2
  effective to do planting. And i think that daily, weekly, quarterly,
  Speaker 1
  i have found, through experimentation with a lot of different options, that really seems oget the job done. Well. O
  Speaker 2
  k, lacklin asks, once work is time blocked, i actually said time box, but i
  Speaker 1
  would course use the term time blocked. How do you break it into manageable chunks? So lacklin, time
  Speaker 2
  block should be a minimum of thirty minutes.
  Speaker 1
  If the things that you actually need to ex take less than thirty minutes, you should batch them together and add them in a block label. So the block labels where you write in the upper right hand corner of the sheet on whichyou'redoing time blocking, the up right hand corner being the corner that it is very unlikely that your fixes to your time block schedule will ever icclude. You can put alitle label in your time block and then put the label up in the up right corner and elaborate what's supposed to happen in that block. You could have a thirty minute block or an hour long block. Label it admint or tasks. Put a number in it, like one with a circle in the upper right corner of the page, put a one with a circle, and list out what are the tasks that you would actually do in that block. If you actually try to make blocks that are less than thirty minutes, you're geting a little bit too precious they are, right? You're trying to get away to, i don't know, precise with these blocks. And your schedules never goin to work. So stick with half hour to our long blocks. Batch together the small things, elaborate on what they are using labels that you explicate up in the upper right hand corner of your time block page.
  Speaker 2
  June asks,
  Speaker 1
  do you get writer's block? If
  Speaker 2
  so,
  Speaker 1
  what do you do to jump yourself out of it. Well, june, i think i may have talked about this before, but i don't believe in writers block. A lot of other professional writers don't either. ([Time 0:09:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8fb66dbc-9b9e-4cc0-8ab9-285ef6bfcab8))
* Slack Helps Minimize That Uncomfortable, Anxiety Producing Feeling

  So
  Speaker 2
  i think the blem that slack solves in a lot of office
  Speaker 1
  environments is
  Speaker 2
  that it helps minimize that really uncomfortable, anxiety producing feeling of messages piling up. You have this inn box and every moment, there's all these messages piling up, and you have to get through all those messages. Each one of these messages is an obligation sent
  Speaker 1
  you by some one else that you now have to fulfil. And it's incredibly stressful that whle you're working on one thing, more
  Speaker 2
  piling up. And you obsessively just have to keep going back to your inn box. You start checking email at night and in the morning on the week ends, because you're trying to keep up. And i sisophean and it's very difficult, and it's an incredible source of anxiety. So
  Speaker 1
  when you shift to a sinkerness tool, like a chat based channel,
  Speaker 2
  like
  Speaker 1
  you get with slack, you
  Speaker 2
  do mitigate a lot of that issue. Cause
  Speaker 1
  if you're not there, if i'm not on the channel for you to talk to, i don't really have a way of just piling up messages for you, right?
  Speaker 2
  So the's at there's this comfort
  Speaker 1
  n i think thisis a good benefit. There's this comfort in when
  Speaker 2
  i am not communicating, nothing's piling up,
  Speaker 1
  right? That or ethic hears you talk to me syncnously if you need something. And so if no one's talking to me, then there's no new obligations accruing, they have to actually grab me, and maybe i won't make myself available until i'm ready to talk. And therefore i take back control. So i think that's the positive, in gess what a lot of people like about slack,
  Speaker 2
  kind of philosophically speaking,
  Speaker 1
  sort of putting aside here, parenthetically, teres a lot of technical advantages people like in terms of transcripts and been able to a search and be ablo have a record of interactions that various stake holders can look at. The're some technical benefits that are very important for certain organizations. ([Time 0:51:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f140cc4-7e13-446f-98ba-713964a953c0))
