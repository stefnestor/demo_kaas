  would even say, if if we're trying to do well and be well, i think, in fact, you actually need to be well in order to do well, or at least, yes, to reach your full potential.
  Speaker 1
  100 %. You got it, exactly.
  Speaker 2
  Well, 18 spokes. Were ot gong to touch on all eight in this conversation, but i wanted to maybe give a ato like an over view, a macro over view, of each of the, you know, the sections or the, you know, we we've got body, we've got mind, and we've got spirit. Let's do a quick summary of of body and then move on to the other two.
  Speaker 1
  Sure. So i'm a real quick summary. And i'm just to make this a little bit fun, i take the hit and im let people know, like, my worst habits and how it turned into this wheel very quickly. So, you know, and i hope people can relate. Um, you know, many of us who who are strivers and working really hard have a crap diet. And what i was doing as getting a lot to go. I was eating chitos for lunch. I'm just kind of grab and go. And that's we have so many um corner stores and things like that, there's super convenient for those of us running to and from work and a on our way and things like that. So the opposite would be, eat a healthy planface diet. Many of us. The second spoke is, get enough sleep. And many of us feel like we're too busy to get to bed on time. There's too much on our plate that its in, you know, wold be inefficient that can't give ourselves the gift of a good night's sleep. So get enough sleep is one of the spokes. Im another spoke i'm going to jump a few here, is hydrate. You know, many of us do what i used to do when i was so sick. I powered myself up in the morning with a giant coffee. And then at lunch, i had a die at coke. Oh, i love the like bubbles and the taste. I used to be so addicted to it. And then in the evening, we bring ourselves down with glass of wine or two. And the issue with all these bad habits i used to have, which got me in the place of being chronically ill while working, is the problem is, is that, im, you're not any better for any of them, you know. And what i'm trying to show people is the actionable opposite, is is how this wheel was created. So, upgrade your products. That means, you know, not using toxic m chemicals, you know, in the products you use on your body, like lotions and shampoo and soap, and even products in your house. A lot of us, you know, ue pretty heavy cleaners, you know, bu could be compromising our health, and certainly exercises in there as well. So, o, i wanted to to am heal myself as fastas possible, and these were the things. O, i'm not trying to be controversial in this. Weel, just like, as you pointed out, most people, i think, would agree that all the aspects of well being that are showed here would help any human body. Like sleep, for instance. We can all agree that getting enough sleep. Everybody's different though, you know, i'm as far as the need im in how many hours are required their specific body, you know, i think that's important. The the key to my work is customization. Like i do think absolutely all of us are different, and that we need to and that's what my book's about, is exploring how do you customi like, if i provide this framework for people, how do they customize it so that they can say, you know what? This is just right for me. ([TimeÂ 0:08:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f9ec444e-fc28-4473-b974-ecadf32c2f8a))
