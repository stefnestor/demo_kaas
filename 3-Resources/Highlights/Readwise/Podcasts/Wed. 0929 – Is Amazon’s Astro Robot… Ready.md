  So i ment to try to learn some more about media lab. It's not often that a company attempts to find success by creating a sort of conglomerate or holding company of under appreciated digita companies. By far, the exemplar of this is i a c, of course. But i a c clearly had a vision for a time when subscription services were the hotness, which has come to pass. It's unclear to me what stitching together all of these arguably failed digita assets would accomplish for betea lab. Microsopt has opened the windows ap store to third party ap stores. Amazon and epic games will be the first store front aps in the coming months. Quoting the verge, just like any other ap third party store front, aps will have product detail page, which can be found via search or by browsing, so that users can easily find and install it with the same confidence as any other ap in the microso store on windows, explains georgio sardo, general manager of the microso store. Today we are sharing that amazon and epic games will bring their store front aps to the microso store over the next few months, and we look forward to welcoming other stores as well in the future. The news months after microsopt announce some major changes to the microsot store. Not only is the store being overhauled for windows 11 and eventually windows ten, but microsopt will also let developers keep 100 % of the revenue from aps if they use alternative payment platforms. The only exception is that this doesn't apply to games. While steam, for example, isn't on the list yet, it could still arrive in the future. Microso commitment to being an open store for an open platform will now allow for any third party store front aps to be listed in the microso store on windows. That doesn't mean separate apsent games from rival stores will be discoverable and installable, but the store for an aps will be listed in search results. The only difference here is with microso partnership with amazon. Microsopt is bringing andrad aps to windows 11, and that includes the ability to discover and search the amazon aps store directly from within the microso store. A preview of this integration will be available for windows insiders soon, small business owners startups, free lancers onterbiners. Do you know the number one way to avoid unfair bank fees?
