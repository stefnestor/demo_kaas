* The Horizons of Focus and Responsibility
  Summary:
  Next actions are the very next, small, single setting, one off action i'd be doing to move something forward. Next horizon up from that what we call projects. Areas of focus generate projects and actions when you want to change what's going on in that area. Top level one is a sense of purpose and values - why does your job roll exist?

  the second thing, lect on them appropriately, is what gives people a sense of perspective, so that you're engaged consciously, rather than unconsciously with how all the pieces in the different horizons fit together. So the horizons, the reason we distinguish and break the stuff up is there are some unique characteristics to each horizon. And there's also a degree of frequency with which you might want view each horizon. And generally the rule is the further out the horizon, the higher up the horizon, the less frequently you'll need to review that. So the first horizon, our favorite horizon, is next actionswhywhy we named the company what we did? And it's it's the part that a lot of people find kind of revolutionary, caus it's that very next step. And that's that thinking about what's the very next, small, single setting, one off action i'd be doing to move something forward. The next horizon up from that what we call projects. You can also just think of as multi step outcomes, or multi step desired outcomes. And it's the end point, right? It's the finish line. It's the dun state that the next actions are going to be incumentally driving you, driving you toward. So those two get ticked off as done at some point. Butthe next level up from that what we call areas of focus, areas of responsibility, are on going, right? So so those are ones that, unless your life's circumstances change in a big way, you're always going to have some of those. And health is one that every human being with a body has, right? You know, as an area focus, it may all be on track, but once it becomes off, you realize, ok, that's an area that i need to give some attention to. And so areas of focus generate projects and actions when you want to change what's going on in that area. The next levels up from that what we call goals, in what we call a vision are, again, a lot like projects, things that get ticked off as as done at some point, things you said you wanted to do. It's just the time line is ther out. With projects, we say within about the next year or so. With goals, two to three years vision, three to five years out. And the reason, just, the reason we distinguish that is really practical. Because your next action lists you want to look at every day. Your project list, you want to look at once a week. But goals, you know, stuff that's two to three years out, you may want to look at quarterly or even annually. That vision stuff, three to five years, is probably a once a year visioning cise. So again, it's just that that practicality of what o you want in the more continual focus in a weekly review, like your projects and what do you want to review, is more of a, let's say, an annual planning exercise or something like that. And then that top level one is, again, something that exists, they all kind of exist to some degree already, but that people may or may not have have a necessarily made conscious a lot. And that isyour sense of purpose and valuesright? So the purpose is the is the big y, either why does your job roll exist, or what gives you a sense of purpose about about your life? And then the values are the things you don't want to go against or transgress as you're going about fulfilling that purpose. I i found certain values for myself when i came to a different culture, right? And this value of just brutal honesty, in being blunt and frank, didn't go over quite as well in the british culture, for example. So you find out that values are to some degree relative when you butt up against some one elsewith slightly different values. But that at's at least my flavor version of the model, in a nutshell. And again, the reason we have these six horizons is ther there's different traits to each, but also there's a different degree of frequency with which you want to be reviewing it. And also, getting clear at each level, or each stage, gives you a different kind of perspective that that broadly what you and what? Didi, what did i miss out there? Tot, what didi, wut i leave out? How would you describe it? ([Time 0:03:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/04b34913-8ea8-4c5f-99bb-29c6e1ebca49))

* The Horizons of Focus Model
  Summary:
  i think the need for this model, again, for people who are not content simply to be just kind of driven by their email inbox s. I'm very happy to be driven by my amal in box. It's absolutely fine, as i see it. That's my job. And if that's your attitude, then there's not a lot, now, then what we're offering here is probably not a lod attractive. But if your goal is that that these longer turm things that are important to you, get enough attention in your world, en spending some time with the horizons of focus model can be very beneficial.That's coing of mya as count im mi

  say when they, you know, consider the question again in two or three years time, what are your five year goals? That will still be a five year goal, right? They will not have made much progress toward it. So, i think it's a, in our world, where the world is coming at us so fast, where the technologies are evolving to allow us to be reminded at, you know, all times of day and night about various things that are happening, a, i think the need for this model, again, for people who are, who are not content simply to be, you know, just kind of driven by their email inbox s. O say that, they say, i'm i some one say this to me in a similar one time. I'm very happy to be driven by my amal in box. It's absolutely fine, as i see it. That's my job. I do emal. And if that's your attitude, then there's not a lot, now, then what we're offering here is probably not a lod attractive. But if your goal is that that these, as i say, that these these longer turm things that are important to you, get enough attention in your world, en spending some time with the horizons of focus model i think, can be very beneficial. That's, that's coing of mya as count im mi take. Wt, what would you reckon? It's a
  Speaker 2
  really a god point, you know? It'. It's such a good point. And the horizon's a focus to me, is where getting things done, as you said, et, gets to be about getting the right things done and getting pro active about what you want. Just a, mean, just recognizing that you have desired outcomes, things that you want to be true that aren't true, is a revelation for some people who who relate to ther their various problems in life, this is a problem, and i need to figure out what, you know, i need to deal with the problem. And we say, what's your desired outcome? And they go, oh, oh, i could have a desired outcome. But again, that's reactive. That's reactive to a problem or a situation that's come, in a sense, to you. And as you say, you know, there's a lot of things, hopes, dreams, goals, ideas that we have, that just acknowledging them and starting to review them regularly changes, in my experience, the orientation of your brain toward that topic. You start to see things differently. You start to experience things differently in relation to that as a stated goal, as opposed to unconscious goal. So, very, very powerful model a, you know, maybe a bit of, a bit of an unsung hero of g t d, and something that that really am i think, you know, any one can start to do with the right prompt and the right, you know, the right sort of inroad to starting to create these horizons of focus for themselves. When you go to do this, i'm curious what is, what is your, what is your process for getting your own horizons of focus exteriorized? Where do you, where do you out? First of all, how do you kind of mind that out for yourself? And then where do you store it? Where do you keep it? How do you review it? What's, what's tod's relationship to horizons of focus?
