  you, can you tell me a little bit about your background as a technologist? Sure.
  Speaker 1
  So. I've been in i t for coming up on 20 years now. Have traversed the roles of, you know, basic d des, top support. I work my way up through systems, administration, systems, engineering, networks, virtual an worked for an m s p for a small amount of time, and then kind of got into a helping the interstructure aspects of cloud. Not too long after that, started working for a a great company, a softwire development company, where i was actually able to sit and work directly with development teams. And from there, i learned a ton. I've been pretty much doing that since then. The business, more or less is traversed outside of our accustomed development teams to actually helping clients of our company. And i've learned a lot, been having a great time.

  technology has certainly changed quite a bit, and it's a rather a treadmill to keep up with at times. You'd mention cloud as being one of those major innovations.

  Speaker 1
  You know, that's a good question. You know, i think that cloud is certainly become main stream. I think that's good for a lot of organizations. I think it's a challenge that many, many organizations are learning about the differences between, you know, more or less running a dayto cenner, running virtual ation and you know, more or less using api to pervision aspects that you're now managing or using.
