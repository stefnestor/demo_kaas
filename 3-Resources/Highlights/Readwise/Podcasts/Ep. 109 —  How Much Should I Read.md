* How Do You Find Day Time to Read?
  Summary:
  The two chapter a day rule is probably the best way to develop a reading habit. Two chapters of something get read every day at least. This will add up to a lot of books as well.

  Speaker 1
  other way to do this is to focus on daily chapters. So i've talked about this before, the two chapter a day rule is probably the best way to develop a reading habit. Two chapters of something get read every day at least. This will add up to a lot of books as well. So either would recommend, i would say what i do, five books. Five books a
