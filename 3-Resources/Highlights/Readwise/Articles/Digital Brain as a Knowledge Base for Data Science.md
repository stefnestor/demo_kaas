## Highlights

* To write down everything and never read it again is synonymous with wasting time.
* I have taken notes on paper, Evernote, notepad, word, napkins, etcâ€¦, in the end, all those notes are not in a specific place, they are scattered everywhere, with different formats and inaccessible, this causes all the valuable knowledge acquired over the years is nothing more than a nice moment of annotation and a perpetual cycle of forgetfulness.
* The acquisition of knowledge in various disciplines can produce new and innovative ideas on reflection of the whole.
* When you have a system where you can keep all the acquired knowledge what you get is a knowledge base, when you can intuitively connect this knowledge what you get is a digital brain, a second digital brain that allows you to go back to each recorded concept, make traceability and be able to expand it at will.
* Markdown format: Obsidian is based on note-taking in a plain text format, it is viewable and editable in virtually any environment.
* Specific focus: Obsidian is specifically focused on creating a knowledge base of perennial notes, that is, notes that do not expire, notes that last over time, are easy to access, and interconnected with each other.
* Dedicated community: Obsidian has a wide range of users who develop plugins from themes to customize the interface or enhance the benefits of obsidian at a very high level, the Obsidian community provides support to anyone who needs help, within the home page itself you have access to a community forum.
* Continuous improvement: Since its release to the real world to date obsidian has maintained a constant evolution as far as updates are concerned, obsidian developers listen to their users and this makes it a very valuable tool for the needs of all users, also the ceiling of the evolution of this system of notes still has a lot of growth potential, what will we see in the future of this tool?
* Within each point there is a specific note connected with other notes, this would correspond to the concept of synapsing the neurons, here is a graphic and functional similarity of the comparison between a human brain and this system of perennial notes.
