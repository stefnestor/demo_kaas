## Highlights

* ETL Is Dead, The Good Stuff Now Is TEL Or ELT
* No Code tools aren’t that awesome.
* I go hard in the paint on this topic in my article titled The Benefits Of Using Python And T-SQL Over SSIS For ETL, so I’m not going to say much here. The bottom line is this, when you know how to code, no code and low code tools just get in the way of proper efficient development processes.
* Knowing how to write clean efficient code is the key to building solutions faster with code than you can with no code low code tools. It does take time to get these skills but, you know what? It won’t take you years like it took me because I’m going to teach you every tip, trick, and tactic I know about writing efficient data pipe through my first college length online class Fundamentals Of Database Programming.
