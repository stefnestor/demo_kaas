## Highlights

* The data warehouse is a specific infrastructure element that provides down-the-line users, including data analysts and data scientists, access to data that has been shaped to conform to business rules and is stored in an easy-to-query format.
* In the process of developing the dimension model for the data warehouse, the design will typically pass through three stages: (1) business model, which generalizes the data based on business requirements, (2) logical model, which sets the column types, and (3) physical model, which represents the actual design blueprint of the relational data warehouse.
* Normalization is a database design technique for creating records that contain an atomic level of information.
