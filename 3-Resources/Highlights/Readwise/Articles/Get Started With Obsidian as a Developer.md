## Highlights

* Although we call it a personal knowledge base or your 'second brain', we also like to think of it as an IDE for your notes. You can think of an IDE as a powerful frontend that tries to understand your code, such as where are functions and variables stored, what are their types, and by doing so make it super easy to navigate code and get suggestions as you type. In this sense, with most of the current note-taking apps, working with notes feels like writing code without syntax highlighting, code autocomplete or Git integration. All the things that programmers have been taken for granted for decades. That's pretty sad, don't you think? Today's knowledge workers are facing new challenges all the time, and they deserve better tools.
* Mapping out ideas in my brain (this newsletter and my book Guide to Tiny Experiments are direct results of that process)Making notes on what I'm learning and readingCentralizing research, resources, and links on a topic or project (this is amazingly useful beyond day job work too ‚Äê I keep track of house and self-care projects, too)Documenting my systems and processes
* The first mistake I made initially was dumping too much information into Obsidian -- attempting to archive every note, article, highlight, or link I could find. I was like The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. This added way too much junk and noise to my Vault. My advice would be: don't treat Obsidian like you'd treat Pocket or Instapaper. Obsidian is most useful when it's a reflection of what's important to you and your own original thoughts, feelings, and notes on what your learning and reading. Think of your Obsidian vault as self-documentation, building a conversation partner that you can think through problems with and that helps you remember things.
* The second mistake I made was adding too much structure too quickly. I migrated a bunch of information from Notion and other places and quickly added a bunch of folders and structure. This was a mistake. In learning from others and gaining experience, I reverted to a simpler approach: letting the backlinks and graph cause the structure to emerge organically. This means being okay for a while with a bunch of notes in a list. The point of this process isn't to categorize a bunch of files, it's to use backlinks and the quick launcher (cmd-O) to organically navigate the way your brain connects ideas. Eventually some structure did emerge, but it was specific to the way I use Obsidian. Allow yourself to build your own system over time.
