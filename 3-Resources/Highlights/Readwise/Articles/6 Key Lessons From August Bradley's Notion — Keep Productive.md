## Highlights

* Daily tasks and accomplishments. August's Notion database tracks the data day-by-day that you want to measure and it also contains a bullet planner. Each day is designed following a specific template that allows you to identify what you want to accomplish. The first part of the daily planner is the Morning Startup, where you can list some daily gratitude and 3 things that would make your day great.

* Identify the problems. In order to come up with the 3 things to complete each day, you have to identify the problems you may encounter and set realistic goals. The Not-to-Do list section will help you to stay on track. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481399974/18722174))
* Commit to avoiding the not to-do's. This is as important (if not more) as your to do list because we know what are the things that put us off track. By identifying them and listing them, we actively try to not let them obstacle us during the day. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481399974/18722175))
* Set your mind in a framework The Mindset section of the planner will help you to visualize yourself going through your day and executing your tasks, building mental models to guide you by giving you the sense that you've done these things before even if it's something new.

* Assess what worked and what didn't. At the end of your day, you should complete the table with your habits and routines and list your daily wins. Ideally, they would be the same listed in the morning when you identified what would have made your day better. Finally, you should list one or two things that can be improved the following day, based on your habit tracking and your wins. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481399974/18722177))
* Do it day after day. Implementing your daily habits and tracking them will allow you to see improvements and assess your progress, avoiding to get yourself lost without achieving your goals. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1481399974/18722178))
