## Highlights

* Vault:
  Your collection of notes. Styles, plugins and application settings are maintained per vault. The number of open vaults correspond directly with the number of application windows open. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1458811913/17939371))
* Note:
  The fundamental component of Obsidian, notes are the pages we interact with and where content is maintained. Notes should be a concise distillation of information as it was interpreted by the author. Notes should be written with the sole intent of being readily usable during subsequent research or active operations. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1458811913/17939373))
* Links:
  Links are the method by which relationships between notes are drawn. Links are denoted by a word or term corresponding to the content of a note which is set between a pair of square brackets “* *”. Second only to the content itself, links are the most important component of the your vault. Without folders, links function as the overarching imposed structure of related data as well as the vehicle with which we navigate it.

* A Note’s Header Containing Links to Associated Categories and a Search Tag
  Categories (Primary/Secondary):
  Categories are our simplification of the more widely adopted term “Map of Content” (MoC). Categories simply serve as a jumping-off point into and around content maintained in your vault.
  Looking for something related to a DLL Hijacking?
  Start with the ‘Red Team’ or ‘Pentest’ Primary Category
  navigate to the Secondary Category corresponding to ‘Persistence’.
  The division of categories into ‘Primary’ and ‘Secondary’ is entirely arbitrary and established merely to assist in rapid filtering of content scope.
  Categories are simply lists of links
  Unlike a folder structure, a single note can belong to one or several categories.
  It is not important that every note related to a Categories be immediately available across Categories where its content may be relevant. Instead, paths into and between notes should be grown organically as the team uses and searches the vault. This strategy accounts for the creation of several navigational routes which ultimately arrive at the same content, a concept which we’ve found is of paramount importance when operating from a shared solution.

* A Primary Category Listing its Associated Secondary Categories
  Search Tag:
  Tags are essentially shortcuts for vault-wide searches. These are defined by a short list of emojis which correspond to categorizations of data types committed to the repository. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1458811913/17939817))
