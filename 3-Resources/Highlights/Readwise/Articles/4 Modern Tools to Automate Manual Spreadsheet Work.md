## Highlights

* Lots of manual work to keep spreadsheets up to date: Weâ€™ve all copy-pasted data from one spreadsheet into another. Sometimes to aggregate data and other times to perform analysis, but what if there was a better way.
* Cleaning data: Before we can even start to aggregate data, there is the tedious cleaning and enhancing step. When columns have bad and inconsistent data, this process can take quite a while.
* Hard to scale: As you start working with larger spreadsheets, querying or editing information becomes quite difficult. Just running some basic operations in Excel with a few thousand rows can be a lot to handle for your computer.
* Disconnected from BI tools: Many BI tools work with databases and not spreadsheets. If you are always working with spreadsheets, using a CSV to SQL tool every time can get pretty annoying.
