## Highlights

* I have been doing my weekly review inside of Obsidian for over a year and have found it to be a really helpful process. It gives me the space to look back at the last week and plan for the next week.
* I typically do this at the end of the weekly review but itâ€™s top of the list so when I sit down on Monday morning, I have my top 3 goals ready to go.
* This section contains a checklist of things I should do to get me in the right frame of mind to do my weekly review. For instance, I have checkboxes for cleaning my desk and for tidying up my inboxes.
* I try not to have too much here. Otherwise, it would be easier for me to procrastinate on these tasks instead of actually doing the weekly review.
* Last Week
* This section is an embed of last weekâ€™s Reflections section. I find it helpful to look at the previous week to see what has changed and what has stayed the same. This also helps to get me in the right frame of mind for doing my weekly review.
* Reflections
* ðŸ”‹What Gave Me Energy This Week?
* ðŸ“‰ What Drained Me This Week?
* Next Week Planning
* I look at the goals and projects Iâ€™m currently working on and try to pick out 2â€“3 tasks to work on next week.
* My top tip: if you do nothing else during your weekly review do this i.e. pick 2â€“3 key tasks you want to work on for next week.
* OKRs
* I am currently looking at moving to OKRs from SMART goals so this is still a little bit of work in progress, however, the concept is still the same.
* Projects
* Oh and one last thing: Iâ€™m thinking about putting together all of my Obsidian templates into a GitHub repo so if thatâ€™s something youâ€™d be interested in just let me know so I can get working on it!
