## Highlights

* Embrace and embody this truth, and you can experience a quantum jump in productivity and free time. It works so well it may seem like magic, but it’s based on solid science inspired by Einstein’s physics. (Chapter 6, The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks)
* This is in contrast to the traditional view of time (Newtonian) that there are 24 hours in a day, one minute watching TV is the same as one minute working on your passion project, and you have to manage that time wisely to make sure you have “enough time”. The Einstein Time view comes from a place of abundance and lets you always have the time you want.
