## Highlights

* Ferret is a pipeline composition scripting framework, allowing you to create and reuse predefined scripts in one cohesive YAML file which is both readable and flexible. Instead of writing an instruction manual, such as a README, describing the steps needed to create your setup, you create a YAML file that describes your steps both descriptively and technically.
* Ferret transforms the documentation into meaningful steps and executes the code, returning a clear output of the progress and status of the steps used in the pipeline itself.
