## Highlights

* It is a dashboard designed to be an easy-to-maintain index into the notes of my vault.
* Make my notes more discoverable by grouping them into related topics.
* As with Wikipedia, promote linking between notes and topics.
* Remember that Personal Knowledge Management or PKM starts with the word Personal. You need to customize this method to your personal needs and preferences.
* The need for simplicity
* I can't emphasize this enough: simplicity. I didn't want to place any constraints on my note-making. I want ideas to flow, research to be gathered, knowledge to be synthesized, and creativity to flourish.
* As you will see, Dashboard++ is made up of two simple things:
* A CSS style sheet you add to your vault that provides some missing formatting powers
* The use of markdown lists for creating structured indexes
