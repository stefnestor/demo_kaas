## Highlights

* dbt does the T in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes — it doesn’t extract or load data, but it’s extremely good at transforming data that’s already loaded into your warehouse.
* In layman's terms, DBT enables data analysts and engineers to write data transformation queries in a modular manner without having to maintain the execution order manually. It compiles all code into raw SQL queries that run against your data warehouse to use existing computing resources.
* It also understands dependencies within your queries and runs them in the correct order. DBT code is a combination of SQL and Jinja; therefore, you can express logic such as conditional statements, loops, filters, and macros in your queries.
* Macros are like functions — you can abstract commonly used snippets of SQL which can be reused anywhere.
