* @joshduffney: Productivity doesn't have to be a hamster wheel.
  Taking breaks is key. Even if it's difficult to pull yourself from your work.

* @TfTHacker: 1/ What is possible with Obsidian? I present some pages people have made with @obsdmd using Markdown and various plugins. Obsidian is very flexible.
  These are collected from Discord server.
  Do you have cool examples to share? Please response to this tweet with screen shots. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1499636459560656903))

* @tracyplaces: 1. Using a light-weight daily template creates a daily "open loop" that scream to be closed. A simple *what I learned today* demands a response. \[See Zeigarnik effect\] ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/tracyplaces/status/1499858826752839682))
* @tracyplaces: EXAMPLE: Matt, Mark, Brandon, Andy, and Ramses are known to search their graphs for:
  • I want
  • I need
  • I feel
  • I wish
  You'd be surprised by what you learn about yourself.

* @tracyplaces: Are you a TfT practitioner? 
  If you are and you tell me you're not a journaler, I'm pretty sure you need to:
  • Do some additional self-awareness work or; 😀
  • Come up with a broader definition of journaling. 😉
  🥊 Fight me.

* @curtismchale: Lots of good links for PKM Weekly. I particularly enjoyed the one about a physical Zettelkasten index system. Get it by signing up - https://t.co/cMZalFOswy ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/curtismchale/status/1500177408292319237))
* @dasaptaerwin: i experimented with @obsdmd to map team member (names=yellow nodes) and their research interests (blue nodes). More blue nodes in the outer ring. So I guess I can say the team has diverse members. :)

* @TfTHacker: From time to time I talk about the importance of documenting your workflows. This is a great example of how to do it. 
  The idea is to have a clear plan how you process knowledge from collection to its final home.
  In this way, your system take on greater meaning & value. https://t.co/zMY0vHKA2o ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1500443540144463872))
* @selfire1: The BibleGateway to Obsidian script has been updated!

* @TfTHacker: Excalidraw plugin for Obsidian is just insane. In fact, it is hard to keep track of all the possibilities. I appreciate Zsolt doing a Showcase to give us the key integration features. https://t.co/BKC54LGQpI ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1500499425462046729))
* @TfTHacker: Sleep is so important to clear thinking. 
  I declare sleep as an official and powerful Tool for Thought.
  Do you agree?

  Links to plugins will directly open Obsidian if the viewer has Obsidian installed. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/obsdmd/status/1500862666310656003))
* @henrikbengtsson: Fresh out of the #Topic/Dev/R oven:
  It is now (= R-devel to become R 4.2.0) possible to use underscore (\_) as a placeholder on the right-hand side (RHS) of a forward pipe, e.g.
  mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> lm(mpg ~ disp, data = \_)

* @ERDonnachie: @henrikbengtsson @rstats_tweets Why an underscore and not a dot? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/ERDonnachie/status/1501308334565036035))
* @mdsumner: @henrikbengtsson what a mighty mighty rise from ignominy to glory for the lowly underscore ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/mdsumner/status/1501308409269817344))
* @TfTHacker: Fellow TfT nerds working in Obsidian, I have to say these docs are nothing short of lifesaving. 
  Great learning resource proving how flexible Obsidian is to extend. https://t.co/tuDCWzucbT ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1501486528102551552))
