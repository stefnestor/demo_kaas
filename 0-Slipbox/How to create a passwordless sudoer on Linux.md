# How to create a passwordless `sudoer` on Linux

*Source: [How to configure passwordless sudo in Linux](https://www.simplified.guide/linux/enable-passwordless-sudo#:~:text=Steps%20to%20setting%20up%20passwordless%20sudo%20in%20Linux%3A,visudo%20by%20saving%20the%20file.%20More%20items...%20)*

Edit the `etc/sudoers.tmp` file:

Using the [visudo](Linux%20Commands%20-%20visudo.md) command:

````bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/vips
````

Then, edit the opened file with the nano editor, adding:

````bash
[your-username] ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
````

mine looks like:

````bash
jimmy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
````

to exit, `Ctrl+X` > `Enter`.

---

Old Method:

````bash
# Edit the sudoers with the visudo command
sudo visudo

# Change the %sudo group to be password-less
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Press CTRL+X to exit
# Press Y to save
# Press Enter to confirm
````

Note that the file now looks like this:

````text
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
