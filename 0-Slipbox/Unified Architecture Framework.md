# Model Based Systems Engineering

*Source: [Unified Architecture Framework™ (UAF™) | Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/hot-topics/uaf.htm)*

The need for architecture-based decision making has never been more important. Industry, government, and DoD are driving toward implementing architecture enabled digital engineering transformation. This transformation provides the means to connect information across and within enterprises.

The Unified Architecture Framework® (UAF®) is a generic and commercially orientated architecture framework based on the Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF™ (UPDM™). UAF defines ways of representing an enterprise architecture that enables stakeholders to focus on specific areas of interest in the enterprise while retaining sight of the big picture. UAF meets the specific business, operational and systems-of-systems integration needs of commercial and industrial enterprises as well as the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other defense organizations.

UAF Profile (UAFP) enables the extraction of specified and custom views from an integrated architecture description (AD) in support of a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. The views describe a system from a set of stakeholders' concerns such as security or information. The UAFP specification supports the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF), the Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF), Security Views from Canada's Department of National Defense Architecture Framework (DNDAF) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Architecture Framework (NAF).
