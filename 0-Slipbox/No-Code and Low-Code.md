# No-Code and Low-Code

 > 
 > Creating software with low-code platforms is a bit like building a house out of Lego blocks. Sure, you can build a house using the pre-defined Lego blocks, and arrange them into something that would resemble an actual "house", maybe even with a working door. But it's going to look different than other houses, be difficult to modify unless you use the same Legos as before, and will probably function differently than if you used raw-building materials to make it.

Low-code simply implies not writing source code in order to build software. Either by using a visual based editor to drag and drop objects on a screen with pre-defined actions, or selecting from a list of pre-rolled applications that do any number of pre-defined functions. You just need a mouse, an idea, and a bit of "you" time to sit and learn any particularÂ low-code platform. That's the dream anyway, and some platforms get closer to that reality than others.
